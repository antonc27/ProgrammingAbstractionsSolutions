Problem 2: Understanding graph algorithms

a) DFS from Lounge

Lounge, Conservatory, Ball Room, Billiard Room, Library, Hall, Dinning Room, Kitchen, Study 

b) BFS from Kitchen

Kitchen, Ball Room, Dinning Room, Study, Billiard Room, Conservatory, Hall, Lounge, Library

c) Dijkstra's algo for minimum path from Lounge to Library

Observe arcs from Lounge
Enqueue Lounge -> Conversatory with cost 3, Lounge -> Dinning Room with cost 4 and Lounge -> Hall with cost 8

Dequeue Lounge -> Conversatory with cost 3
Observe arcs from Conversatory
Enqueue Lounge -> Conversatory -> Ball Room with cost 7, Lounge -> Conversatory -> Billiard Room with cost 10

Dequeue Lounge -> Dinning Room with cost 4
Observe arcs from Dinning Room
Discard Lounge -> Dinning Room -> Ball Room, Lounge -> Dinning Room -> Hall
Enqueue Lounge -> Dinning Room -> Kitchen with cost 15

Dequeue Lounge -> Conversatory -> Ball Room
Observe arcs from Ball Room
Dicard Lounge -> Conversatory -> Ball Room -> Billiard Room, Lounge -> Conversatory -> Ball Room -> Dinning Room, Lounge -> Conversatory -> Ball Room -> Kitchen

Dequeue Lounge -> Conversatory -> Billiard Room
Observe arcs from Billiard Room
Discard Lounge -> Conversatory -> Billiard Room -> Ball Room

Found shortest path Lounge -> Conversatory -> Billiard Room -> Library with cost 14
